# 100 Days Of Code

> I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Iâ€™ve decided to make this a public commitment.

## The Why

A couple of months ago I made a promise to myself; _spend an hour every day learning new stuff_. And yes, in the weekends I would watch a course or read some articles but the time devoted on _'learning'_ was really inconsistent.

By making this _public_ I am trying to commit to this promise. The idea is to track my progress and keep a log of each day writing down the stuff I learned and the tasks I completed along the way.

## The Rules

- I will code for at least an hour every day.
- I will update my log each day and push it to GitHub.
- I code at work but that time doesn't count towards this challenge.

## The Learn

These 100 days are focused on **improving my JavaScript knowledge**.

I am going to focus on a couple of key points:

### Basic JavaScript/ES6

- Refresh my basic JavaScript knowledge (e.g [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org))
- Learning new syntax (e.g [ES6 for Everyone](https://es6.io/))
- Solving real world problems (e.g [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/))

### React Hooks (advanced)

### Firebase API

### GraphQL API

### ExpressJS + MongoDB

### Material UI Architecture (advanced)

The resources above are subject to change but should keep me busy the next 100 days.

- Customize material-UI framework
- Architecture of material-UI
- Integration of symfony framework
