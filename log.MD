    - 10%: width to 10% of parent container (col-3)
    - 2fr: 2/3 of rest space (col-4)
    - 1fr: 1/3 of rest space (col-5)
- grid-template-rows: to define the height and units of rows
- grid-column-gap: define the gap for columns
- grid-row-gap: define the gap of row
- grid-gap: {row_gap} {col-gap}
- grid-column: 1/3; use the index of column-line to consume the columns
- grid-column: 2/4; use the index of row-line to consume the rows
- grid-area: define the placeholder of area, then replace them with any items
- grid-area: 1/1/3/4; "h-start/v-start/h-end/v-end"
